# Day 2 - Collaborations

## Collaborations in complex projects with no experience working with each other
Today I thought I would give my thoughts on how I think working with other organisations or groups can be achieved without loosing time and efficiencies. I am by no means an expert on it, but I have done a few of these ad-hoc projects and starting to get a bit better and its enough to write a little schpeel about. 

Anyone that has been involved in group projects knows they can be a nightmare, project collaborations are much the same, except there is money and reputations on the line that people defend and seems to make them increasingly risk-adverse.

This is obviously not a great thing for promoting innovation, building trust in each other and stretching the limits of everyones ability and growing as people. To try and make sure these issues don't happen, I find the following things always help me. 

### Be straight with everyone, there is no point bulls@@tting
This one is probably something that people dont really think about, and is especially important when you are starting or working on a proejct with people that you dont know, or havent worked with before closely. People (especailly guys/males) have a tendency to overexadurate their capabilities and under-predict time frames. I am guilty of this too and actively working on it. I think this gets overlooked a bit by managers in my experience. It only ends up wastiung everyones time and makes it impossible to for the managers to accurately predict sticking points, critical path and all that good stuff. I would much rather people give me their honest opinion on a task or job and it be more expensive or take longer than I thought it might, as then at least I know and it isnt a surprise later on, surprises are the worst. This is something that some people struggle with, especailly young people that are trying to impress collegues or make a good impression. They usually get a few days of glory then everyone figures they are terrible and their reputaion is screwed. Model of the story, be brave, be honest everyone will repect you and like you for it and the project will be smoother for it.

### Most meetings can be replaced by a good email
I hate emails more than anyone, thats no joke, they drive me insane, especially when Im not there to add value. I think, if the purpose of a meeting is to discuss thing, actually discuss them, then a meeting is a good idea. If it is to disseminate information, write a email. And when I say "actually discuss something" I mean you intended to present an Idea and the best way to get feedback is have everyone in that room (that is relevant) talking about it, drawing on whiteboards and listening to each other and being open minded. I dont know how many times I have gone to a meeting for someone to talk AT me and just click through a powerpoint, that is helping no one, comment the powerpoint and email it to me, stop being lazy. Your get my point, rant over.

### Sometimes you just need to make the decission, even if it isn't the best one
A lot of the time projects get delayed becasue of a lot of little delays on little aspects or components of the project. THis si something that I think elon Musk does well, he makes good, informed decissions and he makes them quickly. You need to think, does this NEED to be perfect, or can it be great and do the job to a degree that will satisfy the goals and aims. Sometimes it does have to be perfect, but a lot of the time it doesn't. For example, I once worked on a project where the team took three days to decide on whether or not we should use metric or impirial bolts. The project was between a US and Australian people so both had merits of use. But the project used two bolts in total... who the hell cares that should have been made in an email, the manager should have said "We are using metric as we are builind it in australia, and Imperial system is dumb". Not the greatest example, but I hope the point has been made. 

### If people aren't passionate, its going to be more work for you 
Ok, my last point, I have realised I could go on forver about this stuff and rant on and on. If you can help it, only work with people or organisations that have common goals, interests or passions. This is way easier said then done, obviously, but sometimes you can choose. Sometime people or groups might just want to be invovled for publicity, or to use other people ideas or they might be forced on you becasue other people think its a good idea. its never a good idea. I always find that when people are being made to do something I could do my work and the work I asked them to do faster than if they helped. It always ends in having to read-over it, fix it, send it back, it is in the wrong direction or just outright wrong and then it has to be done again and it could have been done already if I had just done it. Might seem a bit 'dick-ish' but if you have the oppertunity, work with people ororganisations that want the same thing as you, that they can 'buy-in' to the project and will drive as hard as you will, it makes a world of difference.
