# Day 2 - Collaborations

## Collaborations in complex projects with no experience working with each other
Today I thought I would give my thoughts on how I think working with other organisations or groups can be achieved without loosing time and efficiencies. I am by no means an expert on it, but I have done a few of these ad-hoc projects and starting to get a bit better and its enough to write a little schpeel about. 

Anyone that has been invovled in group proejcts knows they can be a nightmare, project collaborations are much the same, except there is money and reputations on the line that people defend and seems to make them increasingly risk-adverse.
