# Post One - Github

## Intro 
So, introduction, this folder will contain a bunch of random posts outlining various things I and the team go through to make this project a reality. It will be informal and I do not certify that the information is correct in any way, or even that I will use good grammar and spelling, I just want a way to explain how I go about solving problems so that it might help others. There will be posts about project management, funding issues, coding and programming, robotics, 3D design, 3D printing and whatever else is on my mind. I will try to updater as much as I can. 

## Why GitHub
For the first one, I thought I might explain why I have chosen GitHub for this and also go through some basic stuff about GitHub and using it. Firstly, a definition:

" GitHub Inc. is a web-based hosting service for version control using Git. It is mostly used for computer code. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.[3] " - Wikipedia ;)

So its intended for tracking your code, working with others, version control and all that. But it is also a free and fast web service, I don't need to worry about HTML too much, you can make these cool .md files and its fast and I dont neeed to pay for servers or a subscription. If you want it to be private you do need to pay, its not much, like $25 a month. But as this is open source and unclassified, I don't care and thus it will work. 

It is intended for code but any files can be updated and I can add the other project members to add and edit files as they like. Its also good for me to backup and save my code, if I loose or break anything, I just download it again, easy. If I want to go back to a previous version, that is easy too. It also works on all computers, Linux Mac and Windows so it doesnt matter who uses what. 

Thats enough reasons I think. 

## Github tips and tricks (basics)
I am by no means an expert with Github and git. But if you dont want to learn too much terminal stuff, you can use the web user interface that is pretty self explanatory. Alos, if I ever get stuck, I just 'google' it, the internet is full of examples. 

I use Ubuntu, all my install instructions will be for Ubuntu. 

To instal git on your computer:
- sudo apt-get install git

Pretty easy. Windows and Mac, go here: https://gist.github.com/derhuerst/1b15ff4652a867391f03

I have attched a 'cheat sheet' below, these are the basic commands I use from the command line, I find it useful.

Like I said, I'm useless at it, google and stack overflow are your friend, go nuts.
