# Images from the proejct! 
## Battery Boxes

Below is an image of the aluminium battery boxes constructed by RAN personnel. Aluminium was chosen for the following reason:
1. Its light and reducing weight is important
2. The rest of the boat is aluminium
3. It is essentially just a 'splash protector' as the batteries are marinised anyways.

If you look at existing WAMV photos from the RobotX competition or commerically, you won't see many with the batteries mounted here. There were a few reasons why we did it:
1. It is a hassle-free place to mount them
2. Batteries can be easily changed from the wharf or in the water as they aren;t trapped anywhere. This also means new batteries can be swapped out to give a mission turn-around of about 15min (if you have eight batteries).
3. Keeping the weight down-low. The centre of gravity will be kept low, giving a greater GM (Gravity to Metacenttric Height) and hence a greater righting moment, and better stablility. 
4. Can use OEM cables, nothing needs to be shortened or anything like that. This makes it a bit quicker in production, or for replacements. 
5. Around the LCG (Longitudunal Centre of Gravity). From watching videos I saw that a lot of the WAMV platforms trim by the stern, which isnt great for resistance. So keeping the batteries here shouold help with that and make the WAMV sit a bit more even-keel. 
6. Its something different. Hey, if it doesnt work, we can move it. May as well try it and see how we go. 


The image below shows The batteries in their new homes! There is a bit of play, rubber will be installed inside to stop vibration and movement. The base will have automatic drains in the event that water somehow gets in there.
