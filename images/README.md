# Images from the proejct! 
## Battery Boxes

Below is an image of the aluminium battery boxes constructed by RAN personnel. Aluminium was chosen for the following reason:
1. Its light and reducing weight is important
2. The rest of the boat is aluminium
3. It is essentially just a 'splash protector' as the batteries are marinised anyways.
