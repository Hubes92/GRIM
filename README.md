# GRIM
An Open source project run by Royal Australian Navy engineers in the aim of developing people in areas of their interest and to promote collaboration accross organisations and research institutions. The porject is open-ended and sole purpose is the development od people and the building of relationships within industry as well as institutions such as universities. 

# Overview
The aim of the project is to develop an Autonomous/Unmanned Surface Vessel in a progressive and staged manner. There is no end date set for the project, it is intended to be an ever-evolving and developing project enabling all invovled to continually improve and trial new ideas and concepts in the MAS domain. 

## Funded Stages
The stages currently funded in the project are listed below, currently stage zero and one has been completed, with stage 2 underway. 

### Stage 0 - Concept
As the title suggests this is the stage in which the project was defined and the basic needs and requirements were determined. Here I decided what I wanted to do and the direction I wanted to go. It was also where I developed the business case and started floating the idea to people that I though may be interested in being invovled or helping me aquire the gear I would need. In this stage I contacted DSTG initially as I had an string existing relationship with them. I talked about my desire to start a collaborative project by which parties could signal their interest in developing software, a sensor, a behaviour or system and there would be an adaptive and capabable platofrm by which to do it. I wanted it to be Unclassified and Open to all to promote collaborations between big organisations as well as individuals and small companies. I wanted it to focus on the dwevelopment of people and the strengthening or relationships, but also the improvement in capability for defence and industry. 

After initial talks, I managed to find a long forgotten platform sitting in a storage space under the DSTG offices in Redfern. THe platform was a 16ft WAM-V made by maritime advanced research in the USA. I had previous experrience in these craft as I was invovled in the development of a craft whilst at University in Tasmania, The Australian Maritime College. The vessel can be seen in the image below, and is a very capable and effective base platform to develop a USV.

### Stage 1 - Float
This stage was intended to secure the base systems and Building blocks of the vessel. This included aquiring the hull and structure of teh craft, developing the business cases for future stages

# Organisations currently contributing
The following organisations are currently assisitng in the porject, in the provision of parts and equipment, assiting in programming and software devlopment, testing and deployment as well as porject management. All contributions are non-for-profit and the IP is retained by the contributor. The project is being managed by LEUT H Hubbert in his spare time to develop the skill of otehrs in the Navy and foster relationships throughout industry.
